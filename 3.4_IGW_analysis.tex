\section{Gravity wave analysis}
\label{section:IGW_analysis}
We intend to conduct a deeper analyisis of the IGW that goes deeper than making qualitative observations based on timeseries and field plots. We intend to apply a Hilbert transform on the gravity waves in the same fashion that Mercier et al. \cite{mercier_reflection_2008} does. We do this to isolate the different waves common Brunt-Vaisala frequency $N_{BV}$ based on their directions of travel. The four field quantities we intend to extract are amplitude, frequency, and wavenumbers in the two directions. We will first obtain data from the simulation fields by means of a structured gird, since our mesh is not a structured grid. We then apply a Fourier transform of the vertical velocity field $V$.
