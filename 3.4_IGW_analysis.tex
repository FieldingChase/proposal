\section{Gravity wave analysis}
\label{section:IGW_analysis}
We intend to conduct an analyisis of the IGW that goes deeper than making qualitative observations based on timeseries and field plots. We intend to apply a Hilbert transform on the field plots in the same fashion that Mercier et al. \cite{mercier_reflection_2008} does. We do this to isolate the different waves using their respective wave numbers. We will first obtain data from the simulation fields by means of a structured gird, since our mesh is not a structured grid. We demodulate the field by applying a Fourier tranform, apply a filter, and then apply an inverse tranfrom. We are interested in the effects spin, aspect ratio, and stratification have on the IGW along the two directions.
