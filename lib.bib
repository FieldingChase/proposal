	abstract = {We present application of a highly-scalable overlapping grid-based nonconforming Schwarz-spectral element method (Schwarz-SEM) to study the dynamics of rotating ellipsoidal particles. The current study is one of the first to explore the effect of rotation on ellipsoidal particles using direct numerical simulation. The rotating ellipsoidal particles show substantial difference in the dynamics of the flow, when compared against non-rotating particles. This difference is primarily due to periodic attachment and separation of the flow to the surface of the particle for the rotating cases, which results in a higher drag on the particle when compared to the corresponding non-rotating cases. The dynamics is also different from a rotating spherical particle, where a steady shear layer develops near the surface of the sphere. For the rotating ellipsoidal particles, we observe that there is a phase-difference between the position of observed maximum and minimum drag, and the position of expected maximum and minimum drag (i.e., maximum and minimum projected area). A similar phase-difference is also observed for the lift force acting on the rotating ellipsoidal particles. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of explicitly modeling the shape and rotation of particles for studying dynamics of non-spherical particles. Finally, this study also validates the use of non-conforming Schwarz-SEM for tackling problems in fully resolved particulate flow dynamics.},

The comparison between the computed force (or hydrodynamic coefficients) and the literature correlations shows clearly that certain precautions must be taken. The mean deviation of the most accurate correlation considered in the present study from our full DNS results can be of the order of 20\% for the drag coefficient. For the lift and pitching torque coefficients, the deviations can increase up to roughly 25\%.

	abstract = {Using two-dimensional numerical simulations, we investigate a circular cylinder in a stratified flow with a pycnocline of a smooth density profile. We are particularly concerned about the difference between stratified flows and their homogeneous, or unstratified, counterparts in drag coefficients. It is well known that the characteristics of a stratified flow depend on the Reynolds number Re and the internal Froude number Fr. First, we change the incoming flow velocity, with the Reynolds number and the internal Froude number varying simultaneously, in the ranges of 76 Re 579 and 0:14 Fr 1:046, respectively. We find that the flow experiences a sequence of flow patterns, namely “multiple centerline structures,” “isolated mixed regions,” and “vortex shedding,” as we increase this combination, agreeing well with the previous experiments in the low Re and Fr ranges. Meanwhile, the mean drag coefficient decreases, and it drops below the value for a homogeneous state as an empirical stability parameter, k, drops below unity, indicating the transition from a lee-wave dominant wake to an unsteady, vortex shedding wake. This unique variation of drag coefficient is more clearly shown in another situation, when we fix the Reynolds number at Re ¼ 234 while varying the Froude number within 0:094 Fr 4:192. In such a situation, we observe a stable “double eddy” pattern at Fr ¼ 1.87, around which a minimum of mean drag coefficient is reached. At this critical point, we understand that the stratification in the flow inhibits lee-side separation, while the internal waves have not yet played a significant role. Although we observe turbulence-like, strong mixing regions in the far downstream wake for some specific cases, it is argued that the current two-dimensional simulations might not be able to resolve the high Reynolds number or high Froude number cases.},

	abstract = {Flow past a spinning circular cylinder placed in a uniform stream is investigated via 
two-dimensional computations. A stabilized finite element method is utilized to solve 
the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in the primitive variables formulation. 
The Reynolds number based on the cylinder diameter and free-stream speed of the 
flow is 200. The non-dimensional rotation rate, α (ratio of the surface speed and freestream 
speed), is varied between 0 and 5. The time integration of the flow equations is 
carried out for very large dimensionless time. Vortex shedding is observed for α {\textless} 1.91. 
For higher rotation rates the flow achieves a steady state except for 4.34 {\textless} α {\textless} 4:70 
where the flow is unstable again. In the second region of instability, only one-sided 
vortex shedding takes place. To ascertain the instability of flow as a function of α a 
stabilized finite element formulation is proposed to carry out a global, non-parallel 
stability analysis of the two-dimensional steady-state flow for small disturbances. The 
formulation and its implementation are validated by predicting the Hopf bifurcation 
for flow past a non-rotating cylinder. The results from the stability analysis for 
the rotating cylinder are in very good agreement with those from direct numerical 
simulations. For large rotation rates, very large lift coefficients can be obtained via 
the Magnus effect. However, the power requirement for rotating the cylinder increases 
rapidly with rotation rate.},

The flow remains steady at Re=100. At Re=250 and 300, the flow can be classified into 2 flow regimes at these rotation rates. Flow at lower rotation rates is dominated by the well known Kelvin–Helmholtz type instability vortex formation mechanism which produces regular, coherent vortices. As rotation is increased above Ω∗=1.50, the frequency of vortex formation decreases by an approximate factor of two. Linear stability analysis shows that this change in frequency can be attributed to significant changes in the geometry of free shear layers near the surface of the sphere. As rotation rate is increased further Ω∗{\textgreater}2.00, the flow enters the ‘separatrix’ regime. The separatrix divides the free stream flow and the surface-driven boundary layer that engulfs the sphere surface as a result of the rapid sphere rotation. The surface-driven boundary layer leads to better surface pressure recovery and lowers the time-averaged CD. On the other hand, time-averaged CL increases with Ω∗ in the ‘separatrix’ regime.},

	abstract = {An energy extractor based on fully-activated flapping foils operating in a density stratified flow is studied numerically. The effect of stratification strength characterizing as the internal Froude number on the energy extraction performance is first investigated by fixing a typical set of parameters. The hydrodynamic characteristics of flapping foils with different kinematics in the stratified regime are then examined by varying the pitching amplitude. Our results suggest that the stratification effect decreases the energy harvesting efficiency owing to resulting poor synchronization between forces and flapping motion. Within the considered parametric space, the minimum energy extraction performance is identified at the Froude number around Fr=2, giving rise to an attached boundary layer without the favorable flow separation and leading edge vortex shedding. Nevertheless, a sudden increase of extracted power is observed when the stratification level is enhanced to Fr=1, which is attributed to the distinct flow structures generated by the induced internal waves. For the varying kinematics, the Froude number corresponding to the minimum performance is found to increase as the pitching amplitude becomes higher. It is indicated that the induced internal waves tend to dominate the flow patterns at a highly strong stratification, whereas the kinematics of flapping foils still play a crucial role in determining the vortex dynamics for the moderate and weak stratification strength.},

	abstract = {Experimental results are presented to show the development of the flow past a cylinder in a rotating stratified fluid. Both transient and fully developed flow states are investigated, for a range of values of Rossby number Ro and Burger number Bu and for full depth and truncated obstacles. The fully developed flows are shown to be of three main types, delineated respectively as attached eddy pairs, transitional, and vortex wakes, with the boundaries between each flow type being determined by the values of the Reynolds number, the Burger number, the aspect ratio and the ratio of the height of the obstacle to the depth of the fluid. For cases of homogeneous fluid flow, the critical Rossby and Reynolds numbers for vortex shedding are significantly lower than the values found by Boyer. The discrepancy is ascribed to aspect ratio effects and differences in the cylinder shear layer structures in the two studies. The weakening effects of density stratification upon characteristic features of rapidly rotating homogeneous flows are seen to be two-fold: firstly, the wake asymmetries associated with the unstratified flows are seen to be destroyed by the stratification, and, secondly, the retention times of starting eddies, the eddy growth times and the isolated eddy formation times are shown to no longer tune with the background rotation timescale but to scale with the advective timescale of the motion and the aspect ratio of the cylinder. Cross-stream velocity profiles taken at several downstream stations in the wake of the cylinder are used to show a linear increase in the momentum flux coefficient with increasing Re, in the range 55 {\textless} Re {\textless} 135. Velocity profile measurements taken above and downstream of the truncated mcylinder are presented. These show that the vertical distance over which the upper level fluid is influenced by the presence of the obstacle depends strongly upon the value of Bu, and is typically one-tenth of the obstacle height at the highest values of Bu. Finally, flow visualization studies of the motion in the vertical shear layers for Bu = 0 are compared and contrasted with other similar observations, and with theoretical understandings of the flow structure. The importance of the upper boundary condition is clarified.},

Our SEM-based overset grid method is implemented at the level of the NS equations, which are advanced independently within separate subdomains using interdomain boundary-data exchanges at each timestep or sub-timestep. Central to this implementation is a general, robust, and scalable interpolation routine, that rapidly determines the computational coordinates for arbitrary points x*=(x*,y*,z*)∈Ω⊂R3. The communication kernels in gslib execute with at most log  P complexity for P MPI ranks and have scaled to P {\textgreater} 106. Given their performance and robustness, they obviate the need for development of additional MPI-based code for the Schwarz implementation and thus greatly simplify the development of a scalable parallel Schwarz solver. The communication overhead due to the boundary-data interpolation and exchange is only about 1\% of the total time-to-solution for most cases. The original interpolation routine has been extended to support integer and real discriminator fields to choose which domain is responsible for interpolation when more than two subdomains overlap in a given region. We discuss the computation/communication complexity and accuracy of the approach, and present performance measurements for P {\textgreater} 12, 000 processors. We also demonstrate convergence results for the Schwarz-SEM formulation in multiple 2D and 3D configurations and present application of this method to several challenging fluid and heat transfer problems.},

	abstract = {A spectral element method that combines the generality of the finite element method with the accuracy of spectral techniques is proposed for the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In the spectral element discretization, the computational domain is broken into a series of elements, and the velocity in each element is represented as a high-order Lagrangian interpolant through Chebyshev collocation points. The hyperbolic piece of the governing equations is then treated with an explicit collocation scheme, while the pressure and viscous contributions are treated implicitly with a projection operator derived from a variational principle. The implementation of the technique is demonstrated on a one-dimensional inflow-outflow advection-diffusion equation, and the method is then applied to laminar two-dimensional (separated) flow in a channel expansion. Comparisons are made with experiment and previous numerical work.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulation of flow past a two-dimensional rotating cylinder of different thickness ratios at Re = 200 has been carried out to investigate how incremental changes in the cross-section of a cylinder from a circle to a thin ellipse affect their lift and drag characteristics as well as flow structures. In contrast to past studies, the present work considers velocity ratios up to 2.5, where vortex shedding of a circular cylinder completely ceases. Results show that a decreasing thickness generally leads to lower mean lift magnitude, but a non-monotonic change in mean drag with a local minimum at a thickness ratio of approximately 0.375. Interestingly, at velocity ratio 2.5, such minimum drag changes sign and turns into a positive thrust; this event occurs at a much smaller velocity ratio than the case of a circular cylinder. Detailed analysis on vorticity contours and surface pressure distributions reveals that the thrust generation is a result of the competition between a prevailing negative pressure below the cylinder due to rotational motion, and a suction effect from a “hovering vortex” formed above the cylinder. Additionally, as the thickness reduces, the wake transits from a von-Kármán type to a separated flow dictated by the two edges of the elliptic cylinder. And the crests and troughs in the transient aerodynamic forces become highly related to the instantaneous geometric angle of attack, which can be attributed to a projection effect.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the characteristics of flow over a circular cylinder can be significantly altered by introducing rotation and ellipticity. While the effect of the former has been extensively studied; the influence of the latter is less explored. In this paper, we report results of a numerical investigation on the flow past a two-dimensional (2D) elliptic cylinder that is rapidly rotating at a Reynolds number of 200, covering a narrow range of high rotational velocity where low-frequency Mode II shedding occurs for a circular cylinder. Results show that aerodynamic forces and moments acting on a rotating cylinder are highly nonlinear with respect to variation in rotational velocity and cylinder thickness. Various wake topologies are revealed, including steady, quasi-steady, periodic and aperiodic flows. At an intermediate rotation rate, a “hovering vortex” is typically formed on one side of the cylinder, and at high rotation rates, multiple vortices are generated and rotated with the cylinder. These rotating vortices are highly related to a plateau in the mean lift over a certain range of cylinder thickness, as well as a sudden force transition from a mean drag to a considerable mean thrust when the thickness exceeds a certain threshold value.},

The need for an adequate mesh-update strategy is underlined, and various automatic mesh-displacement prescription algorithms are reviewed. This includes mesh-regularization methods essentially based on geometrical concepts, as well as mesh-adaptation techniques aimed at optimizing the computational mesh according to some error indicator. Emphasis is then placed on particular issues related to the modeling of compressible and incompressible flow and nonlinear solid mechanics problems. This includes the treatment of convective terms in the conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy, as well as a discussion of stress-update procedures for materials with history-dependent constitutive behavior.},

	abstract = {The simulation of fluid flow around moving rigid bodies has proven to be a difficult task for traditional computational fluid dynamics solvers. Decomposing the global domain into overlapping subdomains and allowing each subdomain to move independently, permits solutions to many flow problems with complex moving geometries to be determined in a straightforward manner. The present development of the moving overlapping grid method is built within a spectral element method incompressible flow solver, and uses an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation of the governing equations to prescribe subdomain motions. The method maintains global spectral spatial accuracy across the subdomains with the polynomial refinement. The global high-order temporal accuracy of the method is also maintained through subdomain coupling enforced by an explicit interface temporal extrapolation scheme. The method produces aerodynamic forces and vortex shedding around two- and three-dimensional moving rigid bodies that is in line with published experimental and computational data. Additionally, the method achieves near linear computational scaling to thousands of cores.},
