\begin{acknowledgments} 
I am so happy that my advisor helped me. I would also like to thank my lab partner Aditya Parik for helping me learn and understand Linux and its tools. I would like to thank Holland Kartchner for his help in helping me learn Nek5000 tools. I also appreciate his help from when we took a graduate level fluid dynamics course as undergrads and when we took high-performance computing. I would like to thank Ketan Mittal for building the meshes that I used for the simulations, and also for the matlab script he provided for phase-averaging.
