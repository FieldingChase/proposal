\chapter{Approach}
$\label{chp:Approach}
The approach can also be called {\bf Plan to Meet The Objectives:} Describe how, where, and when
each of the objectives will be accomplished. The following text is for reference but isn't necessarily a good example of an approach it is more to show what can be done in latex.

\section{Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ)}

A $P$-stage RVQ consists of a sequence of $P$ single stage Vector
Quantizers.  Let us assume that the RVQ is made up of ESVQ stages.
Each ESVQ is fully described by the set \{ $A^{\rho}, Q^{\rho},
P^{\rho}$ \}.  The method for designing the ESVQ is given in
Algorithm~\ref{alg:LBG}.  Note that this is the ``usual'' codebook
design algorithm.% Note how quotes are used in the previous sentence.

%This is HOW SECTION HEADINGS EXCEEDING 3 inches should be declared
%so that it wraps in the heading but not in the TOC.

%Normally you do the following, and ignore the 3-inch rule:
Throw in some citations \cite{shucker,tbrady,moon,bar1}.
